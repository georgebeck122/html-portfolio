<h2>First Year University Goals + Summer Goals <hr></h2>
<p>The goals over here are to be accomplished within the 8 months of me completing my first year of undergraduate studies at Western University. These goals range from educational and reading goals which will be the source for my financial success, to Deen Goals like getting closer to Allah, and reading the Quran more often, by the end of these 8 months I should never be skipping a prayer. Ever. Final Goals are fitness and networking goals, I should be in the best shape of my life by the time I leave these 8 months, I want to be bulked up and strong. From my Networking connections I also desiere a internship co-op, my first summer out of uni. Inshallah all my wishes are granted. <hr></p>
